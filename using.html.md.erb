This topic describes how to get started with Kibana, a web application that lets you search logs sent to Log Search. You can use Kibana to filter system logs, design visualizations of saved searches, and create dashboards.

The following list describes what you can do with the Kibana component of PCF Log Search:

* [Filter Log Data by Field](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/discover.html#field-filter): You can filter log data based on tags generated by Log Search or any keys within the JSON logs themselves. The **Available Fields** list on the left side of the **Discover** page lists the Log Search tags first, followed by the parsed log keys. Log Search prepends the generated fields with the `@` symbol. See the [Data Dictionary and Search Guide](./search-guide.html) topic for more information about the tags generated by Log Search. 

* Change the [Time Scale](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/discover.html#set-time-filter) and [Refresh Interval](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/discover.html#auto-refresh): By default, the time-scale and refresh rate are set to **15 minutes** and Today's date. 

* [Search Log Data](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/discover.html#search): You can further refine your results from any filter or time span using the search bar at the top of the **Discover** page. 

* [Design Data Visualizations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/visualize.html): You can create visualizations such as **Data Table**, **Line Chart**, and **Vertical Bar Chart**. You can also [customize visualizations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/visualize.html#aggregation-builder) by tailoring your x and y axis with bucket aggregations and metric aggregations. 

* [Create a Dashboard](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/dashboard.html): Create a dashboard to display visualizations and saved searches. You can also apply filters to your dashboard, which affects all the displayed panes. For instance, using the time filter applies your time changes to every displayed visualization and saved search.
